## üéÆ Usage

### Commands

| Command           | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/greet <player>` | Sends a custom greeting to another player. |
| `/timecheck`      | Shows the current in-game server time.     |

### Configuration

All plugin messages can be edited in the `messages.yml` file. The plugin uses the **MiniMessage** format for text, which allows for colors, bold, etc.

**Example `messages.yml`:**
```yaml
# General plugin message prefix
prefix: "<gray>[<gold>Commands</gold>]</gray> "

# /greet command messages
greet:
  received: "<gold><sender></gold> <gray>says hello to</gray> <aqua><target></aqua><gray>!</gray>"

# /timecheck command messages
timecheck:
  success: "<prefix><aqua>The current server time is: <yellow><bold><time></bold></yellow></aqua>"

  To learn more about the MiniMessage format, check the official documentation.
```
